# ðŸ“§ Email Setup Guide

## ðŸ”§ **Current Status**
The app is working perfectly, but email functionality is disabled because email credentials aren't configured.

## âœ… **What's Working**
- âœ… Doctor interface with patient information
- âœ… AI analysis and personalized results
- âœ… Patient portal with personalized chat
- âœ… Insurance pricing and doctor network
- âœ… Complete workflow demonstration

## ðŸ“§ **To Enable Email (Optional)**

### **Option 1: Quick Setup (Gmail)**
1. Create a `.env` file in your project root
2. Add these lines:
```bash
# OpenAI API Key (Required for AI chat)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here

# Email Configuration (Optional)
EMAIL_USERNAME=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password
EMAIL_SMTP_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_SMTP_PORT=587
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@dentalclinic.com
```

3. For Gmail, you need to:
   - Enable 2-factor authentication
   - Generate an "App Password" (not your regular password)
   - Use the app password in `EMAIL_PASSWORD`

### **Option 2: Skip Email (Recommended for Demo)**
The app works perfectly without email! You can:
- Use the patient portal link directly
- Copy the link and share it manually
- Test the complete workflow without email setup

## ðŸš€ **Current Workflow (No Email Needed)**
1. **Doctor Interface**: `http://127.0.0.1:8080`
   - Upload X-ray and fill patient form
   - Get patient portal link
   - Copy link to share with patient

2. **Patient Portal**: `http://127.0.0.1:8080/patient/<patient_id>`
   - Patient accesses personalized results
   - AI chat with personalized responses
   - Insurance pricing and doctor network

## ðŸŽ¯ **Demo Ready**
The app is fully functional for demonstration purposes without email configuration!
