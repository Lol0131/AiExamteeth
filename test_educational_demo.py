These findings indicate areas where tooth structure may be compromised. Cavities form when bacteria produce acids that dissolve tooth enamel. Early detection allows for less invasive treatments like fillings, while advanced cases may require crowns or root canals. The confidence levels help determine treatment urgency. Would you like me to explain the specific treatment options for your findings?'")

Fillings are used for small cavities, crowns for larger damage, and root canals for infected teeth. Each treatment has different recovery times and costs. Based on your X-ray findings, I can explain which treatments might be recommended and what each procedure involves. Would you like me to detail the specific treatments for your situation?'")
